            there is a <em>misconception</em> that in order to exist, good
            things on the net must require an exchange of personal data,
            manufactured scarcity, and a profit motive.

            somewhere along the way we forgot how simple the web can actually
            be.

            at times we looked down at our feet, caught between a stronger
            password and a desktop notification.

            in other moments, we found ourselves heads tipped back, yearning for
            something better than what people told us the web had to be.

            we also love to use these tools to make compelling

            we are extremely proud of how light and tidy these resources are.
            the goal of <em>ampl</em> is to make a suite of tools that embrace
            limitation to make more creative web experiments. the goal of our
            machines is to demonstrate alternative decentralized uses of web
            technology.
