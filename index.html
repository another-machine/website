            There is a <em>misconception</em> that in order to exist, good
            things on the net must require an exchange of personal data,
            manufactured scarcity, and a profit motive.
          </p>

            At times we looked down, thinking of a stronger password, ignoring
            an unwanted desktop notification.

        </div>
        <div>

            In other moments, our heads tipped back, yearning for something
            better than what people told us the web had to be.

            <em>a(nother) machine</em>
            is here to make tools that work within constraints to make a more
            expressive web. Our experiences demonstrate alternative uses of web
            technology. Our hope is all of this makes you excited to build
            something similar.
