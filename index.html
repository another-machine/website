          we use web browser technology to facilitate experiences that reject
          the modern assertion that interesting things on the net require
          personal data harvesting and cloud storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          a(nother) machine makes tools and experiences. our tools are in what
          we call the "another machine public library" (ampl). ampl consists of
          javascript resources for #offlineBehavior. please be kind and be sure
          rewind when you are done using them.
        </p>
        <p>
          we are extremely proud of how lightweight and tidy these resources
          are. our goal with ampl is to make a suite of tools that embrace
          limitation to make more creative web experiments.
        </p>
        <p>the public library currently consists of:</p>
        <p>@ampl/devices: motion, orientation, user media, and midi</p>
        <p>@ampl/lexicon: topics and constraints used to make word games</p>
        <p>@ampl/music-detection: detecting music in audio streams</p>
        <p>@ampl/music-theory: music notation and key generation</p>
        <p>
          - @ampl/procedural-generation: time based seeded rng for device
          synchronization
        </p>
        <p>@ampl/sound-synthesis: generating sound with web oscillators</p>
        <p>@ampl/steganography: encoding and decoding data in image pixels</p>
        <p>
          we also love to use these tools to make compelling experiences free of
          cloud complexity and completely private. these experiences include:
        </p>
        <p>
          AVVA: two independent machines, one turns music into color, the other
          color into music. point them at each other, then get in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lexicon Standoff: a 3+ player word game, try to determine who is an
          imposter
        </p>
        <p>
          Mindmeld: lightweight two person collaborative word game for any time
        </p>
        <p>Modulo: the coolest step sequencer with a command prompt</p>
        <p>
          Sonic Pixels: a sound player, but the file format is digital images
        </p>
