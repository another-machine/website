            There is a <em>misconception</em> that in order to exist, good
            things on the net must require an exchange of personal data,
            manufactured scarcity, and a profit motive.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>At some point we forgot how simple the web can be.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            At times we looked down, thinking of a stronger password, ignoring
            an unwanted desktop notification.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            In other moments, our heads tipped back, yearning for something
            better than what people told us the web had to be.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            We fail captchas, install ad blockers, block location access
            requests, agree to cookie policies, and frantically close scroll
            locking popups.

            Many <em>experiences</em> and the <em>tools</em> that build them
            exist to further this abrasive form of the web.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            We make <em>experiences</em> and <em>tools</em> to build them with
            an expressive web in mind.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>

            We also love to use these tools to make compelling
            <em>experiences</em>, free from cloud complexity, cheap to
            distribute, free to use.

            <em>a(nother) machine</em>
            is here to make tools that embrace limitation to make a more
            expressive web. Our machines demonstrate alternative uses of web
            technology. Our hope is all of this makes you excited to build
            similar things.
